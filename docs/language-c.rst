Language: C/C++
===============

C and C++ programs use libvsql, a shared library that provides the routines of
the SQL/CLI (ISO/IEC 9075-3, the "Call-Level Interface"). Since it's a C
library, it can also be used from any other language that can call C
functions.

Install/Update
--------------

The release (see :doc:`install`) has the library in ``lib/``
(``libvsql.dylib`` on macOS, ``libvsql.so`` on Linux) or, on Windows, in
``bin/`` next to ``vsql.exe`` (``libvsql.dll``). Its header is
``include/libvsql.h``, and there's an example (``example.c``) in the top
folder. ``bin/``, ``include/`` and ``lib/`` are the usual layout of an install
prefix, so the folder can be copied into one, such as ``/usr/local``.

To build it from the repository instead, run ``make libvsql``. That creates
``bin/libvsql.dylib`` (or ``bin/libvsql.so`` or ``bin/libvsql.dll``), and the
header is ``libvsql/libvsql.h``.

Routines
--------

Each routine is documented in
`libvsql.h <https://github.com/elliotchance/vsql/blob/main/libvsql/libvsql.h>`_,
which is C99 and also works with C++. The routines that are supported so far
are listed in :doc:`sql-compliance`.

Example
-------

``example.c`` is the :doc:`language-v` example, written against libvsql:

.. literalinclude:: ../libvsql/example.c
   :language: c

From the folder of a release, compile and run it as C with:

.. code-block:: sh

   cc example.c -Iinclude -Llib -lvsql -Wl,-rpath,"$PWD/lib" -o example
   ./example

Or as C++ with:

.. code-block:: sh

   c++ -x c++ example.c -Iinclude -Llib -lvsql -Wl,-rpath,"$PWD/lib" -o example
   ./example

The ``-rpath`` is where the program looks for the library when it runs. Leave
it out if the library is installed somewhere the system already looks, such as
``/usr/local/lib``.

On Windows, compile it with MinGW (``gcc``, or ``g++ -x c++``), which links
directly against ``libvsql.dll``, and leave out the ``-rpath``. Windows has no
rpath, so the program finds ``libvsql.dll`` in its own folder or on the
``PATH``:

.. code-block:: sh

   gcc example.c -Iinclude -Lbin -lvsql -o bin/example.exe
   bin/example.exe

The release doesn't have an import library (``libvsql.lib``) for MSVC.

Either way, it outputs:

.. code-block:: text

   1.23
   4.56
